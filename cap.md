# Introduction 
üö¶ Traffic congestion is a pressing concern in many major cities, mainly caused by minor accidents which inevitably lead to more accidents. These accidents, though often minor in nature, contribute to increased congestion. Our pioneering solution "Raqeeb" (ÿ±ŸÇŸäÿ®) is designed to alleviate traffic stemming from these accidents and, more crucially, mitigate the risk of subsequent incidents involving pedestrians. Ultimately, our approach results in reduced traffic congestion, decreased hazards, and quicker resolution of occurring accidents. Additionally, our system incorporates drowsiness detection to address driver fatigue-related accidents. 

"Raqeeb" tackles both traffic congestion in major cities and cost reduction for operating on accidents by addressing four common accident scenarios. We accomplish this by utilizing car dash cams to analyze video footage, which allows us to accurately determine accident responsibility in an easy process.

#### **Cases covered:**
- A car hitting another one from behind 
- A car hitting another one from the right
- A car hitting another one from the left
- A car being hit by another one going backward 

#### *Models used:*
- Yolo v8
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Classification 
- Random Forest 
- Logistic Regression 

### **Problems**
- Insufficient training data 
*Solution*: Used a simulator to generate accident data 
- Representing each video in a single row
*Solution*: Sampled 12 frames from each video starting from where the accident happened and then presented as a list 

### **Objectives**
- Build a model that accurately predicts covered cases 
- Streamline the process of uploading a video and generating a report
